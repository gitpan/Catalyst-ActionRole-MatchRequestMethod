=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
our $VERSION = '0.01';



    use Moose;
    use namespace::autoclean;

    BEGIN {

    }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        action_roles => ['MatchRequestMethod'],

    sub get_foo    : Path Method('GET')                { ... }
    sub update_foo : Path Method('POST')               { ... }
    sub create_foo : Path Method('PUT')                { ... }

    sub foo        : Path Method('GET') Method('POST') { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to write L<Catalyst> actions which only match certain
HTTP request methods. Actions which would normally be dispatched to will not
match if the request method is incorrect, allowing less specific actions to
match the path instead.
